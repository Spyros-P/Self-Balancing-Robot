README-DOCUMENTATION OF FINAL PRODUCT

This is a project for a Self Balancing Robot implemented with a PID controller, along with an external controller-transmitter the parameters of which (P, I, D) were modifiable with potentiometers from said controller and sent to the robot via a small antenna in real-time, and shown to the user via a screen within the controller interface.

#### Result & Verdict

The Robot could reliably balance itsself after tweaking the PID parameters for well over a minute of runtime. It could also keep its balance when very small forces were applied. The reason for that, we believe, were the motors, whose maximum torque was far too low to safely restore balance after every external force application. We found, however, that they were more than capable enough to 'help' the robot restore its' own balance.
